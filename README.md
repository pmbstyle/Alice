## ✨ Key Features

### 💻 Local and Cloud use

Alice is designed to work with Cloud(OpenAI/OpenRouter) and Local LLMs (Ollama/LM Studio).
Has built-in speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and embedding services.
While the OpenAI cloud API is preferred and provides the best user experience, Alice can also operate **fully locally** (experimental).

### 🗣️ Voice Interaction

* Fast, VAD-powered voice recognition (via `gpt-4o-transcribe` or `whisper-large-v3`)
* Natural-sounding responses with OpenAI TTS and optional support for local multilingual text-to-speech via Piper TTS
* Interruptible speech and streaming response cancellation for smoother flow

### 🧠 Memory & Context

* **Thoughts**: Short-term context stored in Hnswlib vector DB
* **Memories**: Structured long-term facts in local DB
* **Summarization**: Compact message history into context prompts
* **Emotion awareness**: Summaries include mood estimation for more human responses

### 🎨 Vision & Visual Output

* Screenshot interpretation using Vision API
* Image generation using `gpt-image-1`
* Animated video states (standby/speaking/thinking)

### 🪄 Computer Use Tools

Alice can now interact with your local system with user-approved permissions:

* 📂 File system browsing (e.g., listing folders)
* 💻 Shell command execution (`ls`, `mv`, `mkdir`, etc)
* 🔐 Granular command approvals:

  * One-time
  * Session-based
  * Permanent (revocable)
* 🔧 Settings tab "Permissions" lets you review and manage all approved commands

### ⚙️ Function Calling

* Web search (including Searxng support)
* Google Calendar & Gmail integration
* Torrent search & download (via Jackett + qBittorrent)
* Time & date awareness
* Clipboard management
* Task scheduler (reminders and command execution)
* Open applications & URLs
* Image generation
* MCP server support

### 💬 Wake Word Support  
With the local STT model, you can now set a **wake-up word** (like "Hey, Siri").  
- Alice will always listen, but only process requests when the wake word is spoken.  
- Default mode is **auto language detection**, but you can also select a specific language in settings. 

### 💻 Dedicated Chrome [Extension](https://github.com/pmbstyle/alice-chrome-extension)

* Ask Alice about your active Chrome tab
* Context menu for selected text on a web page
  - Fact check this
  - Summarize this
  - Tell me more about it

### 🎛️ Flexible Settings

Fully customizable settings interface:

* LLM provider selection between OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio
* Cloud or local TTS, STT, Embeddings
* Model choice & parameters (temperature, top\_p, history, etc)
* Prompt and summarization tuning
* Audio/mic toggles & hotkeys
* Available tools & MCP configuration
* Google integrations

### 🔨 Custom Tools

Alice supports [custom tools](https://github.com/pmbstyle/Alice/blob/main/docs/custom-tools.md) that are defined in JSON and backed by local scripts.

1. Open *Settings → Customization → Custom tools*
2. Upload or drop your script (writes to `custom-tool-scripts/`)
3. Click **Add Tool**, fill in metadata, and paste the JSON schema. Saving updates `custom-tools.json`
4. Toggle the tool on/off in the list. Only enabled + valid entries are offered to the model.

### 🎭 Custom Avatars

Swap Alice's appearance with [your own](https://github.com/pmbstyle/Alice/blob/main/docs/custom-avatars.md) video loops:

1. Create a folder under `user-customization/custom-avatars/<AvatarName>/`.
2. Drop `speaking.mp4`, `thinking.mp4`, and `standby.mp4` into that folder (all required).
3. Open **Settings → Customization → Assistant Avatar**, hit **Refresh**, and pick the new avatar.
